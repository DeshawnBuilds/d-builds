data/site.ts                 all content: pillars, latest builds, projects,
                             articles, learning path, social links
```

## Editing content

Almost everything lives in `data/site.ts`.

- **New essay:** add an entry to `articles`. It gets a page at
  `/writing/<slug>` and shows in the archive with an "in development" note
  until a body is added.
- **Social links:** add `{ label, href }` items to `socialLinks`. They appear
  in the footer and on `/follow`. The list is empty until real URLs exist.
- **Imagery:** the art plates in `components/BuildArt.tsx` and
  `components/PortalVisual.tsx` are abstract CSS stand-ins, to be swapped for
  real, optimized assets.

## Not yet connected

- **Newsletter:** the form is UI only. Submitting shows a local
  "connection coming next" message. Nothing is sent or stored.
- **Placeholders:** sections marked "In development" are honest placeholders,
  not unfinished content passed off as finished.

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel from `main`. No configuration required.
